# stock-analysis
VBA project
## Overview of Project

In this project, we help Steve to find best choice for investigation of all his parents money. His parents are passionate about green energy so they decided to invest into Daqo New Energy Corporation. According to this, Steve created an Excel file containing the stock data. We use VBA to help him to automate analyses by calculating “Total Daily Volume” and “Yearly Return”of Daqo stock to know how actively DQ was traded and performed over the last few years. We found that the yearly return for Daqo droped over 63% in 2018 so we decide to provide an overall summary of the total daily volume and return percentage for each stock to find better choices by creating a flexible macro for running multiple stocks. 
In this challenge, we should refactor our code to be more efficient and be used for analysis thousands of stocks by taking much lower time to execute.

## Results and Analysis

By Reviewing all stocks in 2017 and 2018, we discover in 2017, all stocks had positive return percentage except “TERP”, while  “DQ” had a positive return rate about 199.4%, that is the highest yearly return of all stocks in 2017.

So according to above tables,
